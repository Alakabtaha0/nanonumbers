              Once payment has been made, it takes up to 10 business days to deliver the SIM card by post. 
              Requested numbers need to be created, activated with the network for the first time, 
              registered to your name and delivered to you. We will keep you updated throughout the process.`

              just ensure you keep it active. We recommend placing the mobile number on a contract
              with any of the major UK network providers. A welcome and instruction pack is included with all purchases. 
              These provide detailed instructions on how to register ownership, access the online account or transfer networks.`

    title: 'Can I keep my contract?',

              Step-by-step instructions on how to do this will be shared post-purchase – it is free and usually takes 24hours. 
              Your contract will continue as normal and your old number will be replaced with your newly created number. 
              Our numbers work with all UK network providers.`
